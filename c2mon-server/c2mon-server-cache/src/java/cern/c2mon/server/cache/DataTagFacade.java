/**
 * Facade bean used to access DataTag objects in the cache (including ControlTag objects, which extend
 * DataTag).
 * 
 * Notice that the methods that take a DataTag object as parameter assume
 * this is a reference to the object in the cache (although they will also work
 * with objects that do not reside in the cache). On the other hand, methods that take
 * the cache object id as a parameter will retrieve the reference in the cache. 
 * 
 * <p>All Synchronize on the DataTag object lock.
 * 
 * <p>Calls to most invalidate and update methods set the cache timestamp to the current
 * time, with both src and DAQ timestamps set to null. Only the <java>updateFromSource</java> 
 * method sets the src and DAQ timestamp as those received from the DAQ and the cache timestamp 
 * to the current time. 
 * 
 * Methods in this class are also responsible for notifying the listeners that an update has
 * occurred.
