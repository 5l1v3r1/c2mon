/**
 * This class is provided to solve the following
 * problem when running a distributed cache:
 * once the shutdown has started, the node is no
 * longer able to modify distributed objects, such
 * as acquiring a distributed lock. This prevents a
 * clean shutdown of the server.
 * 
 * To overcome this, the node is given a forewarning
 * and has 30 seconds max to finish processing any 
 * outstanding batch jobs.
 * 
 * Once the prepareForShutdown() method returns, a
 * response is send to the shutdown process (started
 * by the script) and the server process will be killed
 * (first gently, then forced).
